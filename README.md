## Node Version
This project requires Node.js 22.

## Installation

```sh
npm i
```

## Local Development
_Note that this will run a watcher for both SASS and AEM changes_
```sh
npm run dev
```

### AEM Development
If you don't want to make any style updates, and are only touching JS files, the following will run a watcher for just those AEM changes.

```sh
aem up
```

## Linting
Note that linting must pass before committing changes, otherwise the automated build will fail.

```sh
npm run lint
```

## Compile Just SASS

```sh
npm run sass
```

## Local development
1. Create .env file with the following content: AEM_PAGES_URL=https://main--stateofnebraska-aem--ociostateofnebraska.aem.page (where the url the env where you want to pull the content from)
1. Install the [AEM CLI](https://github.com/adobe/helix-cli): `npm install -g @adobe/aem-cli`
1. Start AEM Proxy: `aem up` (opens your browser at `http://localhost:3000`)
